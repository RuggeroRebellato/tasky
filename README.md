# Tasky: A Simple CLI Task Manager

**Tasky** is the centerpiece of my upcoming Rust course, designed for beginners and intermediate learners eager to master Rust through a practical and engaging project. This project provides a hands-on approach to learning Rust by covering foundational and production-ready concepts.

Whether you're new to programming or transitioning from another language, Tasky will expose you to core programming practices in a fun and practical way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (1.80 or later)
- Cargo

### Installation

#### Install Rust

Using rustup (Recommended):

If you're running macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, download Rustup and install Rust by running the following in your terminal. Follow the on-screen instructions.&#x20;

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/tasky.git
$ cd tasky
```

Build the project:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

Run the project:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

## Usage

Once you run Tasky, you'll be greeted with a menu of options:

```plaintext
Welcome to Tasky!
> What would you like to do?
  - Add Task
  - List Tasks
  - Complete Task
  - Remove Task
  - Exit
```

### Examples

**Add a Task**: Follow the prompts to add a task with a description and tags. Tasky supports selecting existing tags or creating new ones interactively.

**List Tasks**: View all your tasks with completion status. Tasks are neatly displayed with tags and identifiers.

**Complete a Task**: Select a task from the list to mark it as complete.

**Remove a Task**: Easily remove a task by selecting it from the menu.

## File Structure

Tasky uses JSON for data persistence:

- **tasks.json**: Stores your tasks.
- **tags.json**: Manages your tag system.
